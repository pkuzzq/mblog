We initially had mainly applicants from Europe, however, because we aim to provide a global distribution of instructors to support the global community, we've been working to increase applicants from other areas such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. Other aspects we have been taking into account for selection are, previous R/Bioconductor experience, organising experience, languages they can teach in, and how they intend to contribute to Bioconductor teaching. For Year 2, we aim to select some applicants in Latin America, as we currently have none there, aswell as applicants from other areas. We will be selecting for Year 2 in July and you can still [apply in this form](https://forms.gle/SGaVkDZqCNKNSnHKA) if you're interested.\n\n## Training of selected applicants\n\nThe Year 1 applicants are onboarding now and are at different stages of the process. The first step is attendance at an online [Carpentries instructor training workshop](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/index.html), followed by completing [3 checkout tasks](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html) (teaching demo, discussion, lesson contribution) within 3 months after the workshop. So far 3/18 trainees have completed the Carpentries certification - Fabricio Almeida-Silva, Leo Lahti and Charlotte Hutchings üëèüëèüëè. Once certified, the instructors will teach/co-teach one of the [Bioconductor Carpentries Modules](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/education-training/) within one year of certification. We connect with the trainees at the [monthly teaching meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2QMk5XA-uhBVprAO3ZDk1Yfv1cnUWLp9zdvYq9Feu4/) and in the [Bioconductor Slack group](https://slack.bioconductor.org/). We are looking forward to working with all of the new instructors and supporting them to provide Bioconductor training to the global Bioconductor community.\n\nWe are grateful to the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's EOSS program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-high-quality-training-and-support-for-a-worldwide-community/) for funding this initiative.\n\nUpdate May 2023: Due to changes in availability, Mercilena Benjamin has been replaced by Roberto Alvarez-Martinez. This change was made prior to Mercilena's commencement of the instructor training program.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Year 1 Bioconductor Carpentries instructor trainees\n\n<iframe src=\"map.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Name                                |Affiliation                                                  |Location   |\n|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|\n|Almut L√ºtge                         |University of Z√ºrich, Departement of Molecular Life Sciences |Zurich     |\n|Anand Ruban Agarvas                 |University Hospital Heidelberg                               |Heidelberg |\n|Charlotte Hutchings                 |University of Cambridge                                      |Cambridge  |\n|Chia Sin Liew                       |University of Nebraska-Lincoln                               |Nebraska   |\n|David Shih                          |University of Hong Kong                                      |Hong Kong  |\n|Fabricio Almeida-Silva              |VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology                   |Ghent      |\n|Givanna Putri                       |Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research          |Melbourne  |\n|Javier Carpinteyro Ponce            |University of Maryland                                       |Maryland   |\n|Leo Lahti                           |University of Turku                                          |Turku      |\n|Marie Hidjo                         |African Institute of Biomedical Science and Technology       |Harare     |\n|Oliver Crook                        |University of Oxford                                         |Oxford     |\n|Pageneck Chikondowa                 |African institute of Biomedical Science and Technology       |Harare     |\n|Roberto Alvarez-Martinez            |Universidad Autonoma de Quer√©taro                            |Quer√©taro  |\n|Rodrigo Arcoverde Cerveira da Silva |Karolinska Institute                                         |Stockholm  |\n|Sehyun Oh                           |City University of New York                                  |New York   |\n|Umar Ahmad                          |Bauchi State University                                      |Gadau      |\n|Zedias Chikwambi                    |Chinhoyi University of Technology                            |Chinhoyi   |\n|Zuguang Gu                          |German Cancer Research Center                                |Heidelberg |\n:::\n:::\n",
