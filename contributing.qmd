# How to contribute

Articles posted on the Bioconductor community blog are authored using
[Quarto](https://quarto.org).
The way to contribute a new article is as follows:

1.  Create a fork of the [biocblog repository](https://github.com/Bioconductor/biocblog) on GitHub. ![](./GitHubForkButton.png) And Git clone it to your local environment!

2. [Install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and double click the `biocblog.Rproj` file in the cloned repo. The latest release of RStudio (v2022.07 at this point) includes support for editing and preview of [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents.

3. [Create a new `qmd` file](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#posts-directory) in your RStudio, and check the content with clicking `Preview Website` button under the `Build` tab! ![](./PreviewWebsiteButton.png)

4. If including images:

   i) compress the images with a tool like `pngquant`
   `pngquant --ext .png --force my_figure.png`
   
   ii) add [Alt Text](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#caption-and-alt-text).
   
5. If including code, render the `qmd` locally and commit files changed in the [`_freeze` directory](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#using-freeze). 

6. When you're done, please `git commit` the raw `qmd` plus any static files you might have added/updated in the post's source directory or `_freeze` directory. Don't commit any generated files, such as html.
    
7. Send a Pull Request requesting that we accept your article! 

Once we see your Pull Request, we'll take a look at your article, suggest
changes as necessary, then publish it when it's ready.
